Breakout Plan:

1. Breakout variant: Of the variants that I read about, my favorite was definitely Worms.
The idea to "hide" power-ups inside the blocks led me to the idea of making the bricks 
harm the paddle, even after the brick has been destroyed. This is a complement of the Worms
version in which bricks help the player after they have been destroyed.
2. The first level will be pretty easy. The ball will be quite slow, the bricks will be far
from the paddle, and the paddle itself will be quite large. There will be ~18 blocks (3 x 6)
[][][][][][]
[][][][][][]
All the blocks will break with one hit. However, there will not be power-ups in this initial
level. The second level will have half the blocks take one hit before breaking, whereas the
others take two hits to break. On this level, there will be 24 blocks.

The ones that take two hits to break will fall down, and if they hit the paddle on 
their way down, then the paddle will lose a life. There will be power-ups on this level. Furthermore, 
the ball will move 10% faster, and the extra row of blocks means that the blocks will be
closer to the paddle. On the third level, there will be one row of blocks that takes 3 
hits to break. Furthermore, a random block in the bottom row of blocks (the one that takes 3 hits)
will fire a laser straight down. If this laser hits the paddle, the paddle will break. 
Power-ups will also be on this 3rd level. The ball will also be 10% faster compared to the
previous level. The 3rd level will have 24 blocks, as in the 2nd level. The fourth level will 
be the final level and will have 2 layers of blocks. The bottom layer will take 3 hits for each
block to destroy, and they will fall down. The top layer, however, will be comprised of one giant 
block that will shoot lasers that are "guided" toward the paddle, as in they will travel in the 
direction of the position of the paddle when the laser was initially finished. 
This block will take 10-15 hits to break, and it will disappear completely. It also will
teleport randomly from one side to another inside the top row. If the player beats 
this level, they win the game. But, this level will not have power-ups, and the paddle is 20% smaller 
compared to the previous level and the ball moves 15% faster. This level will look like this:
[]          (This block teleports).    
[][][][][][]

3. There will be 6 blocks:
-Block that takes one hit, and disappears instantly.
-Block that takes two hits to break, and will fall down on the screen, with no power-up.
-Block that takes two hits to break, will fall down, and has a power-up.
-Block that takes three hits to break, and shoots lasers straight downwards.
-Block that takes three hits to break, but does not shoot lasers at all.
-Block that takes 10-15 hits to break, and has guided missiles.

4. I plan to create 5 power-ups:
-Make the paddle as long as the width of the screen so that the ball will not go out of bounds on the bottom.
-Make the ball super-destructive so that it destroys all balls in its path until it hits the paddle again.
-Make the paddle 50% faster.
-Make a shotgun blast of 4 balls that go in 4 different directions but disappear after hitting one block.
-The ball freezes in air and the paddle shoots lasers upwards constantly for 10 seconds.
 Each laser inflicts one hit on the block it comes in contact with, and then it disappears.
 
 5. I plan to make 4 paddle abilities:
 -Paddle becomes as long as the screen (by power-up).
 -Paddle shoots lasers (by power-up).
 -Paddle becomes 25% faster (for the last level). 
 -Paddle moves from one end of screen to other side of screen: it wraps around (after 2nd level).
 
 6. I plan to make 5 cheat codes:
 -Pressing letter 'R' resets ball to original position.
 -Pressing letter 'I' makes the ball bounce off all walls, including the bottom.
 -Pressing letter 'C' moves on to the next level. 
 -Pressing number '5' spawns 5 different impervious balls that bounce off all walls and
  hit the blocks.
 -Pressing letter 'H' gives an extra life.
 
7. My substantive addition is to make the blocks fight back. In the easier levels, they simply fall down
and if they hit the paddle, they make the paddle lose a life. In the harder levels, the blocks shoot
lasers, either straight down or aimed at the paddle. This addition makes the game more of an offense-defense
game, which requires quick thinking to avoid the lasers and blocks AND still catch the ball. However, I do not
think these additions will make the game overly hard which is why I think it will give the game higher replay
value. Another small addition I made was to make a block teleport, which raises the difficulty of the game overall,
otherwise it could be too easy and thus, boring.
